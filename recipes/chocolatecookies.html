    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This recipe is my <em>grandmother's.</em> This will be the best chocolate cutout cookie you have ever tasted! Very chocolaty with a lot of <strong>bold</strong> flavors! Everyone asks for the recipe when I bake these! The kids love them so its time to share!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients!!</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps!</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt; set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg. Gradually stir in the sifted ingredients to form a soft dough. Divide dough into 2 pieces, flatten and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/8 inch in thickness. Cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters. Dough will be sticky so be sure to add more flour to the rolling surface as needed. Place cookies 1 1/2 inches apart onto cookie sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
